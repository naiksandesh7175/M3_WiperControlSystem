# Abstract :- 

A Wiper Speed Control System Controls the operational speed of the wiper in accordance with the rain condition.
This Wiper Speed Control System is used in all types of vehicles the main purpose is to clean the rain air drops present in front screen of the vehicles. 
It is very difficult to drive the vehicles in rain condition so in this case we will use wipers to clean the front screen of vehicles which is mirror so that we can drive the vehicles even in rain also


When there is rain in weather conditions while driving vehicles, the visibility is compromised at the driver end in the car or vehicles we say which poses a great threat to life.as so In this situation, the wiper control system which we are going to develop comes to the rescue. But the traditional wiper speed control system requires constant driver attention in adjusting the wiper speed based on the severity of rain in a weather conditions. Because this manual we are making adjustment of the wiper speed distracts the driver's attention, it can lead to accidents which is in dangerous zone  thus making the existence of this whole system futile.
